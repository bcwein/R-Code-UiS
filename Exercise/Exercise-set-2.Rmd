This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute
code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

This notebook is shows my solution to the exercise sheet for week 35 in STA510
course at the University of Stavanger.

# Import libraries

```{r}
library(ggplot2)    # Library for plotting
```

# Problem 1

Let $X$ be exponentially distributed with density function 
$f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$ for $x > 0$

a. Make a sketch of this density (e.g. for $\lambda = 1$) and compute the expectation and the
variance of $X$ as a function of $\lambda$.

```{r}
fexp <- function (x, lambda = 1) {
  return(lambda * exp(1)^(-lambda*x))
}

x <- seq(0, 5, 0.01)
plot(x, fexp(x, 1), type="l", col= "blue")

exp = integrate(function(x) x*fexp(x), lower = 0, upper = Inf)
exp
```
