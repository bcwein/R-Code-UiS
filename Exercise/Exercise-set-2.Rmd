This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute
code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

This notebook is shows my solution to the exercise sheet for week 35 in STA510
course at the University of Stavanger.

# Import libraries

```{r}
library(ggplot2)    # Library for plotting
```

# Problem 1

Let $X$ be exponentially distributed with density function 
$f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$ for $x > 0$

a. Make a sketch of this density (e.g. for $\lambda = 1$) and compute the expectation and the
variance of $X$ as a function of $\lambda$.

```{r}
fexp <- function (x, lambda = 1) {
  return(lambda * exp(1)^(-lambda*x))
}

x<-seq(0, 5, 0.01); y1=fexp(x, 1);

plot(x, y1, col="red", type="l", xlab="x", ylab="pdf")
```

## Calculate E(X)

```{r}
integrate(function(x) x*fexp(x, lambda = 1), 0, Inf)
integrate(function(x) x*fexp(x, lambda = 2), 0, Inf)
integrate(function(x) x*fexp(x, lambda = 3), 0, Inf)
integrate(function(x) x*fexp(x, lambda = 4), 0, Inf)
```

The lifetime of a type of light bulbs follows an exponential distribution with 
expectation 10 000 hours.

b. Let $X$ be the random variable for lifetime of a light bulb.
Calculate the probability:

## $P(X < 10000)$

```{r}
pexp(10000, rate = 1/10000, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
```

## $P(X > 5000)$

```{r}
pexp(5000, rate = 1/10000, lower.tail = FALSE, log.p = FALSE)
```

## $P(5000 < X < 10000)$

```{r}
pexp(10000, rate = 1/10000, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE) -
pexp(5000, rate = 1/10000, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
```

# Problem 2

a. Calculate the probability that there will be exactly 2 accidents during one 
year.

Calculate the probability that there will be at least 3 accidents during one
year.

## $P(X = 2)$

```{r}
dpois(2, lambda = 2, log = FALSE)
```
## $P(X < 3)$

```{r}
ppois(3, lambda = 2, lower.tail = TRUE, log = FALSE)
```
b. Calculate the probability that there will be exactly 2 accidents during half 
a year.

2 accidents during half a year gives us $\lambda = 1$

## $P(X = 2)$

```{r}
dpois(2, lambda = 1, log = FALSE)
```
c. Calculate the probability that there will be at least 20 accidents during ten
years (Hint for the manual calculation: By the Central Limit Theorem a Poisson 
distribution with expectation larger than 15 can be approximated by a normal 
distribution with the same expectation and variance as the Poisson distribution)

## $P(X < 20)$ when $\lambda = 20$

```{r}
ppois(20, lambda = 20, lower.tail = FALSE, log = FALSE)
```


d. Calculate the probability that there will be more than 2 accidents on this
road during a year when we know that there has been at least one accident.

This gives us:

\begin{equation}
P(X > 2 | X > 1) = \frac{P(X > 2 \cap X > 1)}{P(X > 1)} = 
\frac{P(X > 2)}{P(X > 1)}
\end{equation}
